# Company Database Manipulater

## Description
This program would help keep track of the organization of a company. It has multiple tables that show the departments, the different job positions, which is addressed as roles, and the employees.

This program taught me how mysql can interact with node. It also gave me more inquirer experience, which I imagine will be a very useful tool in the future. I looked at a mock-up a little too late. Maybe next time it'd be better to look into other inquirer options besides prompt().

## Installation
It's important to install inquirer, console.table, and mysql2.

## Usage
Simply run server.js to initiate the function promptGenerator, which makes an inquirer prompt that takes input from the user to decide what they want to do with the database. Next, it will either display the information, or it'll ask additional questions to obtain more data. Finally, it'll use that data to make the user's desired alterations to the database.

It is important, at this moment, to type the prompt responses in the first question exactly as they are written in the prompt.
